/**
 * A {@code Promise} represents the result of an asynchronous computation.  Methods are provided to check if the
 * computation is complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of the computation.  The result can
 * only be retrieved using method {@code get} when the computation has completed, blocking if necessary until it is
 * ready.  Cancellation is performed by the {@code cancel} method.  Additional methods are provided to determine if the
 * task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled. If
 * you would like to use a {@code Promise} for the sake of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can
 * declare types of the form {@code Promise<?>} and return {@code null} as a result of the underlying task.
